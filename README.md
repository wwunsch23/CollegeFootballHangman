# College Football Hangman

## About the Game
This game is a keyboard based game where the player tries to guess the name of the school before all the guesses are up. 

Start the game by pressing any key. As you continue to guess letters the game will keep track of the letters you guessed. Each time you guess, the number of guesses remaining will go down by one. The letters guessed are tracked and displayed to the user. The player cannot guess the same letter twice.

If the player successfully guesses the school name, the number of wins will go up by 1, the player will see the school's football helmet, and the school's fight song will play. After 30 seconds, the game will automatically reset and the user can play again. If the user does not guess the name of the school before the number of guesses remaining reaches 0, then it is a loss and the game will automatically reset.
